1. What was the most challenging piece of this assignment? Did you find it easy or
   challenging to work with HTML and CSS? How long did this overall assignment take you?
   I think the most challenging part is the workflow of the projects. Since it is a multiple-page design, it is easy to feel not knowing where to start or lose track on what I was doing. I find it is easy to work with HTML and CSS but I need to keep in mind of not overriding styles. It took me around 20hrs for this assignment.

2. What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?
   First of all, I make the navigation bar from one line alined with logo&title, to two lines under logo&title. Secondly, I changed the layout of the contact page and home page for mobile devices for them to fit in a smaller screen. I also used flexbox in my gallery page to make it responsive to page width.

3. What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?
   Is there anything that youâ€™re particularly proud of?
   I want my website to be simple and easy to read. The color schema is harmonious. The most proud part of my website is the timeline design. I spent time to learn it and eventually created something that suits my website.

4. Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your
   site in the future?
   I would like to use JavaScript to make my contact form actually functional. Currently it only has a look. I would also make the layout of my gallery more organized and has an effect of hover over the picture to show text, instead of showing text directly under the pictures.
5. How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
   20hrs.
